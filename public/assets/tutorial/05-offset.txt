// === TUTORIAL 05: Offset ===
// We can keep the time interval the same, but play 
// sounds at a different position in the bar by 
// using a second argument for the offset

new sample kalimba_g time(1)
new sample kalimba_a time(1 3/16)
new sample kalimba_e time(1 3/8)

// These sounds all play 1 time per measure
// one starts at offset 0, one at 3/16 and one at 3/8
// Try different offsets like 1/16, 3/4, 1/32
