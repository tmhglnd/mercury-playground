// === TUTORIAL 111: Chance ===
// Instead of a 1 (100%) or 0 (0%) in the play method, 
// we can also use a decimal-point value that represents
// a percentage of chance that the sound will play

set tempo 115

new sample hat_808 time(1/16) play(0.6)
// play hat 60% of the time

new sample kick_808_long time(1/8) play(0.3)
// play kick 30% of the time

new sample snare_808 time(1/2)
// by default the sound is played 100% of the time

// Try some different percentages with values between 0 and 1
