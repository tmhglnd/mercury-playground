// === TUTORIAL 428: Merge ===
// With the merge function you can combine multiple lists into
// a 2-dimensional list. This can be useful when you want to generate
// some chords for example.

set scale minor d
// different rows of notes are generated with various functions
list row1 spread(6 0 12) 
list row2 cosine(6 3 7 19)
list row3 drunk(6 3 12 24)
// the rows are merged into a 2d list and every item is repeated 4 times
list chords repeat(merge(row1 row2 row3) 4)
print chords
