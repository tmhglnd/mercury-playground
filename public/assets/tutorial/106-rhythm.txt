// With a list we can make more complex patterns 
// like a beat of 1's and 0's
// A list is just a collection of numbers (or words)

list hatBeat [1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1]
new sample hat_808 time(1/16) play(hatBeat)

// 1 means play the sounds, a 0 means skip it
// Try changing the values and length of the list 
// For example: [1 0 1 1 0]
