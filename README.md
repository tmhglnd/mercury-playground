# 🌕 Mercury Live Coding Playground


**Welcome to the Mercury Playground! ✌️ ☮️ Make Music, Not War!** ☮️ ✌️

**Mercury Playground is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music performances running in the browser**

Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) (you're in the right place)
* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury)

[**🚀 Start coding directly in the playground!** (recommended for beginners)](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

**👾 Or code with the latest full version in Max8:**

`git clone https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury.git`

[**📟 Build a local app from the browser version with Electron**](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-app)

[**🙏 Support Mercury by buying me a coffee ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/tmhglnd)

[**💬 Join the Mercury Community on Discord**](https://discord.gg/vt59NYU)

## 📟 About 

**Mercury is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

## 🎮 Features Overview

Quick access to playback of samples and change timing and tempo of samples or synthesizers

```java
set tempo 89

new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
new sample hat_909 time(3/16)
```

Make rhythmic patterns with sequences of numbers and probabilities

```java
list loBeat [1 0 0 1 0.5]
list hiBeat [0 1 0.2 0]

new sample tabla_lo time(1/8) play(loBeat)
new sample tabla_hi time(1/8) play(hiBeat)
```

Generate psuedorandom melodic content for a synthesizer in a range and set a scale

```java
set scale minor a
set randomSeed 31415

list melody random(16 0 24)

new synth saw note(melody) time(1/16) shape(4 100)
```

Generate sequences algorithmically to compose complex structures and choose from an extensive library of algorithms to work with

```java
set tempo 132
list rhythm euclid(32 13)

list melody spread(5 0 24)
list melody palindrome(melody)
list melody clone(melody 0 5 7 3)
list melody lace(melody melody)

new synth triangle time(1/16) note(melody 1) shape(1 80) play(rhythm)
```

Design sounds with various effects (and upload your own sounds to use)

```java
new sample chimes time(2) speed(0.25) fx(reverb 0.3 15) fx(drive 10) fx(shift 3 0.5)
```

Easily give multiple instruments the same effects

```java
new sample chimes time(2)
new sample harp_down time(3)
new sample gong_lo time(5)

set all fx(reverb 0.5 11) fx(drive 1.5) fx(filter low 2000 0.6)
```

Sync audio loops to the tempo of your music

```java
set tempo 97

new loop amen time(1)
new sample kick_house time(1/4)
```

Control external midi devices or applications by sending midi and cc <!--and use clock sync-->

```java
new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/16) note(7 1) name(mDev)
    set mDev length(1/16) gain(0.8) chord(off)
    set mDev cc(10 [20 50 100])
```

Sequence Hyrda visuals with instruments (experimental)

```java
list hydras ['osc(10,0.1,2).out()' 'osc(20,-0.5,5).out()' 'osc(5,1,12).out()']

new sample kick_min time(1/16) play([1 0 0 1 0]) visual(hydras)
```
<!-- 
Control other environments via OSC-messages

```java
ring params [0.25 0.5 0.75]

new emitter osc address(yourDevice) theParam(params) time(1/4)

// emits => /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.5
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.75
//          /yourDevice/theParam 0.25
//          etc...
```
-->

Easily control parameters in Mercury via external OSC-messages (only when running [localhost](#-install))

```java
new synth triangle fx(reverb '/synth/verb') fx(filter low '/synth/cutoff' 0.4) time(1) shape(1 'synth/length')
```

**AND MANY MORE (TO COME...)**

The playground (browser version) does not have exactly the same functionality as the original Mercury environment running in Max8. See below the differences. You may also encounter some discrepancies in syntax and in the documentation. Please report issues if you find any so they can be fixed. Items marked with a `*` are only available in the browser version.

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Coding

You can code together in Mercury by using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.cc/) live coding environment for the browser developed by Damián Silvani (a.k.a. Munshkr). Flok is a web-based P2P collaborative editor for live coding music and graphics. Similar to Etherpad, but focused on code evaluation for livecoding.

- [Start coding together here](https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/collaborate#flok--mercuryplayground)

## 🚀 Install

😎 **No need for installing!** You can start coding immediately in the browser:

[**https://mercury.timohoogland.com/**](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

### 💻 Running without internet

🤓 If you want to run the MercuryPlayground locally (for using without internet, or using the OSC-messages functionality, or when developing extra features) you can follow these steps:

You can also code a small Hydra snippet inside the `visual()` function. This function can be added to a specific instrument and is evaluated upon triggering of the instrument. Please see tutorial `601` on the mercury playground site.
